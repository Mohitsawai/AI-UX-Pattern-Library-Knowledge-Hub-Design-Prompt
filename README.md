1. Core Platform ComponentsThe hub must be structured into three main areas, each with specific AI functionality:1.1. The Pattern Library (Design System)This component hosts reusable UI components, tokens, and design guidelines.ElementRequirementAI Enhancement PromptComponent PageMust show: Live code, design file link, visual examples, usage guidelines (Do's and Don'ts), and accessibility notes."Explain this component's usage to a new Frontend Engineer whose primary language is React and is building an e-commerce checkout flow." (Generates contextual, role-specific guidance.)Search & FilterStandard keyword search and taxonomy-based filtering (e.g., 'Category: Navigation', 'Status: Stable')."Find me a button component that is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA and can be used to initiate a destructive action." (An LLM-powered search that understands intent, technical specifications, and accessibility standards.)Design HandoffTool to export specifications (e.g., CSS properties, spacing values) for a specific component."Generate the JIRA ticket acceptance criteria for implementing the 'Date Picker' component, ensuring it covers all mobile breakpoints and error states." (GenAI populates structured documentation/tickets.)1.2. The Knowledge Hub (UX Principles & Research)This component hosts articles, research summaries, UX laws, and accessibility standards.ElementRequirementAI Enhancement PromptResearch SynthesisUpload long-form user research reports (e.g., PDFs, transcripts)."Summarize this research report, focusing only on findings related to user friction in the signup process, and suggest three testable hypotheses for reducing it." (GenAI performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on research documents.)Content GenerationAbility to query the entire knowledge base."What is the difference between Fitts's Law and Hick's Law, and how should that distinction influence my design of a complex data dashboard?" (Generates comparative, synthesized answers drawing from multiple sources.)Principle ApplicationLinks high-level UX laws to specific UI patterns."Show me all UI components in the Pattern Library that are examples of the 'Aesthetic-Usability Effect' principle." (AI links abstract principles to concrete design elements.)1.3. Governance & Contribution ModuleThis component manages the intake, review, and status updates for new design elements.ElementRequirementAI Enhancement PromptContribution IntakeA form for submitting a new component or pattern."Review this proposed 'Empty State' component documentation for tone, clarity, and adherence to our internal style guide. Suggest a better title for the 'Usage' section." (GenAI performs content and style critique.)Compliance ReviewTool to check a new component against a predefined checklist (e.g., naming conventions, required props)."Generate a compliance score (1-100) for this component based on our 'Accessibility Checklist' and list the top 3 high-severity failures." (Automated compliance scoring based on structured data/rules.)Version ControlTracking and documentation of component updates and deprecation."Draft a concise announcement for the deprecation of the old 'Tab Bar' component, explaining the benefits of the new component to Product Managers." (GenAI creates stakeholder-specific change log communication.)2. Technical and UX RequirementsCategoryRequirementInformation ArchitectureA clear, logical, and consistent navigation structure that allows users to seamlessly move between Patterns, Principles, and Process documentation.DesignThe UI must be clean, highly searchable, and utilize the design system it documents, serving as a best-practice example of its own patterns.PerformanceAll AI features must respond in under 5 seconds to ensure an efficient workflow for the user. The platform must be hosted for high availability.Data SecurityAll uploaded research and proprietary data used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) must be secured and not used to train the public models.IntegrationMust provide APIs to allow for integration with external tools (e.g., Figma, GitHub, Jira).3. DeliverablesHigh-Fidelity Prototype: Interactive prototype of the three core platform components with sample content.AI-UX Interaction Map: A diagram showing the flow of how a user inputs a query and how the GenAI models process and surface the response across different data sources (Pattern Library vs. Knowledge Hub).
